AdInject
========

The project includes the AdInjectLibrary and a sample example to show 
how to use the library to inject ads into your existing table views.

You just need to download the whole package and run the project within the package.
"AdInjector.h", "AdInjector.m", "AdRequest.h" and "AdRequest.m" are essentially the 
library files. The rest belongs to the sample project.

Showing the ad in a UIWebView within a table view cell cause the app to exceed given
CPU limitations and it is need to be worked on.

At first, it is a bit hard to understand what is expected from the library
and how to construct the library and the client architecture. To finish on time
I believe one needs to be familiar with the domain and existing sdks.
